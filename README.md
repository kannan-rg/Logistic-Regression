# Logistic-Regression
Predicting chronic kidney disease from data using logistic regression classifier

We will go through the entire data pipeline from data cleaning, preprocessing, staging and modelling on a relatively small dataset (400 entries). We will compare different machine learning models and try to measure their performance using various metrics.

Summary
-------
It is a binary classification problem
Features include numerical values and categorical values
There are missing values within features and need to impute missing numerical and categorical values
Categorical features need to be converted to numerical using the encoding methods
Find the correlation between the features
Find the distribution of numerical features and normalise if required
Model the prediction with logistic regression classifier
Display the coefficients and form the logistic regression equation.
Evaluate the model using cross validation methods(k-fold)
Draw the decision boundary
Visualise the test results
